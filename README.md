# Subnauticraft

My attempt to recreate parts of Subnautica with minestom & Kotlin  

You can view the progress on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@subnauticraft) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/subnauticraft)  

I'm looking for people to collaborate with if you want to help create a map, add new features or create a texture pack feel free to do so and submit a pull request you can also join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/ECCekVKxxr) to talk.  

No public instance is hosted at the moment im planning to do that once there's actually some content.
